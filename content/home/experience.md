  Member of a team of researchers from the [Artificial Intelligence Center (AIC), SRI International](https://www.sri.com/about/organization/information-computing-sciences/aic) participating in the DARPA program: [Radio Frequency Machine Learning Systems (RFMLS)](https://www.darpa.mil/program/radio-frequency-machine-learning-systems)
  
  Tasks:

  * Developed and maintained an RF spectrum simulator for fast and reproducible experimentation.
  * Implemented and benchmarked reinforcement learning approaches to control/steer an antenna array for RF monitoring.
  * Experimented with alternative training regimes such as imitation learning. This method led to better performance than the available baselines.
