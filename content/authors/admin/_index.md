I am a second-year graduate studying **Computer Science** at the **University of Massachusetts (UMass), Amherst**. I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering) from IIT Guwahati in May 2018.

I developed an interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence during the sophomore year of my undergraduate degree. Consequently, I tried to understand the theory of machine learning as well as apply the same. At the time, I attempted to grasp the theory through extracurricular courses, majorly on Coursera, MIT Opencourseware and Stanford Online. I am making the most of my graduate courses to explore several avenues of machine learning. I am fortunate to be working with fellow graduates at the **Information Extraction and Synthesis Laboratory (IESL)** at UMass.

I sporadically blog (I mostly edit and proof-read) on [Medium](https://medium.com/inveterate-learner).
